        <h1>END GUN VIOLENCE</h1>
        <p id="subh1">Being able to live without the fear of gun violence is a basic right. </p>
        <p > By every measure, the crisis over gun violence has continued worsen over the pandemic. It has cut through celebrations, houses of worship,grocery stores, malls, schools, funerals. The pandemic exacerbated all of the inequities we had in the U.S. â€” along racial, health, social, and economic lines, all of the drivers of gun violence. Despite media attention drawn more towards mass shootings, gun violence has ravaged local Black and Brown communities for decades, even more so during the pandemic. It is going to have to take more than thoughts and prayers to address this crisis.</p>
